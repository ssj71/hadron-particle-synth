				<h1>Hadron Particle Synthesizer</h1>
				<p>The Hadron particle synthesizer is the ultimate creative tool for
				granular synthesis. It is available as a Max For Live device and as a
				VST plugin.</p>
				<p><img style="width: 507px; height: 181px;" alt="" src="images/M4L%20Hadron%20GUI%20V6.jpg" /></p>
				<h2>Features</h2>
				<p>Hadron can be used for many purposes in sound design. It can be used as a
				synthesizer or an audio effect, and it can seamlessly morph between
				different sound processing methods. Some of the typical uses of the
				device provide fat analog monosynths, granular delay effects, time
				stretching, formant shifting, transient manipulation, vocal synthesis,
				FM synthesis, sonic clouds, live sampling and sound morphing. The
				synthesis engine is controlled by parameter states, and you can morph
				between states using the 2-dimensional X-Y pad. Specific timbral
				manipulation within each state can be controlled by the four expression sliders.<br /></p>
				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
				<p>The core of the synthesis engine behind Hadron is an extremely flexible implementation
				of a granular audio generator. Due to it&#8217;s ability to generate all
				known types of granular synthesis (and a few new variants as well), we
				propose to use the term particle synthesis to describe the audio
				processing method.
				<br />To control the particle synthesizer engine,we&#8217;ve built a system for easy manipulation of the large number of
				parameters involved in the synthesis process. This system gives the
				user access to a six-dimensional parameter space of sonic control.
				Currently, over 200 parameter values are used to define how the
				synthesis process is executed, and consequently what sound you will get
				out of it. One such set of parameter values is called a state (you
				might be familiar with using the term preset for such a set of
				parameter values, but we&#8217;ll use that term later to define a collection
				of states that will work together). Each state has 4 expression control
				mappings, providing the user the expressional ability to modify a
				subset of the 200+ parameters values defined in the state. A preset in
				Hadron consists of 4 states, and a method for interpolation between
				these states. Interpolation between states is controlled by a
				2-dimensional control surface, with one state residing in each corner
				of the control surface. Since a state represents a specific mode of
				granular audio processing, this system lets the user interpolate
				between different sounds and different sound processing modes. In
				addition to the 4 states, a preset also contains selection of up to 4
				waveforms used as sources for the synthesis process. Which of these
				waveforms is actually used is defined by the state, and the graphical
				user interface displays an activity indicator on each of the 4 waveform
				selectors roughly indicating how much each waveform is currently used
				in the synthesis process. The waveforms can be read from sound files,
				they can be live sampled audio fragments, or they can be read from
				realtime audio input.&nbsp; When realtime audio input is used, Hadron
				acts as an advanced &#8220;granular delay&#8221; effect. This is activated by
				selecting audioInput as the source waveform in Hadron.<br /></p>
				<h2>Using Hadron in Ableton Live</h2>
				<p>Hadron is installed in your Live library under &#8220;Audio Effects/Max Audio
				Effect/HadronForLive&#8221;. Here you&#8217;ll find the Hadron device itself
				(HadronForLive), a midi sender device (HadronMidiSender), and various
				Hadron preset files.
				<br />For typical use:
				<ul><li>- load HadronForLive on an audio track, and </li>
				<li>- load HadronMidiSender on a midi track.</li></ul>
				This way, midi data (midi notes) will be sent from the midi track to the
				Hadron Audio device. If you only use effects states (states with an fx
				prefix in the name), you will not need to load the HadronMidiSender<br /></p>
				<h2>The different types of Hadron states</h2>
				<p>Parameter states in Hadron can be divided into categories depending on what kind
				of processing the state provides. The state names start with a two- or
				three-letter prefix signifying the state&#8217;s type.
				<br /><ul><li>fx: This type of state lets Hadron be used as an audio effect for live audio input.
				These are normally used with audioInput selected as the waveform
				source(s).</li>
				<li>&nbsp;tfx: Similar to the fx state type, these states
				provide processing of a live audio input signal. The tfx states require
				midi input to make sound, as the audio output is muted when no midi
				notes are sent to Hadron.</li>
				<li>gr: Audio synthesis states, where the perceived pitch is constituted by the grain rate (the number
				of audio particles/grains created per second)</li>
				<li>gt: Audio synthesis states, where the perceived pitch is constituted by the transposition
				of sound inside each audio particle/grain.</li></ul>

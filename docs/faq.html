				<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
				<h2>Why is the device itself free, while the presets and states are not?</h2>
				<p>The Hadron device/plugin is released as open source and is provided free of charge. 
				We have a firm belief in the power of open source software, and you can even delve into the code and change anything you don’t like.</p>
				<p>The parameter states provide a sound design library for Hadron, these are not free. 
				They are carefully crafted to provide production-ready functionality, and you can buy states to cover your sound design 
				needs with  Hadron.  In some ways this is comparable to a buying sample CDs for your sampler. When you buy Hadron states from us, 
				you are licensed to use them in your own sound productions in any way you like.</p>
				<p> A small collection of states is included for free when you download the Hadron device/plugin, 
				to get you started and to whet your appetite for more states. When you buy more states you support our development 
				of new preset packs and additional functionality in future versions of Hadron.</p>
				<p>We can also design custom states for you, if our current preset packs don’t cover your needs. 
				Such custom states could later be offered to other customers in new preset packs, or, if you like, 
				we can keep them privately available for you so you can be sure your sound processing arsenal is unique. 
				Pricing for custom states will depend on whether you want to keep them private or if you’ll let us sell them to others. 
				We could also agree on a scheme where we keep the states private for a specific period of time, and after this period we 
				include them in our collection of preset packs available to other customers.
				If you have specific ideas for new states, don’t hesitate to contact us.
				</p>
				<h2>Where can I buy more states and presets?</h2>
				<p> You can buy more states, presets (combination of states) and source sounds at the web site 
				<a href="www.partikkelaudio.com">www.partikkelaudio.com</a></p>
				<h2>Can I use my own sound files as source sounds?</h2>
				<p>Source waveforms require an analysis stage to be used with Hadron. At the moment, there is no method available 
				for analysis of user sound files. We are working on a small application that will enable you to import and analyze 
				your own sounds to be used with Hadron. This application will be offered on 
				<a href="www.partikkelaudio.com">www.partikkelaudio.com</a> when it is ready.</p>

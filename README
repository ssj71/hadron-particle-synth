this is a fork of the hadron particle synth to make whatever changes are necessary to run in linux. Tthe system this is being done on is Ubuntu 15.10 with csound version 6.04. Hopefully in the end it will work for a variety of distros. 

This repo does not include the necessary states directory because they are under a proprietary license. To get these necessary files go to http://www.partikkelaudio.com/downloads/hadron-particle-synthesizer and download the source code. Then you can copy the states directory and contents into this repository dir and run.

I'm really just to book-keeper here. Many thanks to all who have helped me figure out how to run it.
